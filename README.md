# Shoot them all
It is a simple 2D game created for an IT competition. 
Player controls the cannon and he has to shoot to obstacles. It is not so easy, because gravity acts on projectiles. He has a limited number of shoots. Every fifth obstacle shot down, they become smaller and smaller. Our goal is to get as many scores as we can. Max score is 100.
